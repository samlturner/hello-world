# hello-world

Hello Programmers of the World!

My name is Samuel Turner. I'm a rising developer studying at Virginia Tech.
Right now my favorite two languages are Java and C++.
I have been working on learning Python and Javascript recently.
Also I have been working on growing my knowledge of Data-Structures and Network Security.

Feel free to look have a look around, especially once I get more work uploaded.

Sincerely,
Sam
